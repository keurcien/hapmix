## Details from [1]

- SNPs with missing data in the parental genotypes were removed using PLINK 1.07
- Parental genotypes were phased with fastphase and FCGENE
- Model selection: time since admixture, recombination rate
- SNPs ancestries with probabilities higher than 95 percent were considered

## Statistics computation

For SNP $i$, the proportion of Populus balsamifera ancestry in Populus Trichocarpa
admixed individuals, where $$p_{k,j}^i $$ denotes the probability that SNP $i$ of
indivual $k$ has $j$ ancestries from Populus Balsamifera

$$\displaystyle P_i^{\text{balsamifera}} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^n 1 \times 1_{p_{k,2}^i > .95} + 2 \times 1_{p_{k,3}^i > .95}}{2n} $$
